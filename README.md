# DeepInteraction
Using deep learning to predict complex traits using genotypes, utilizing non-linearity of a MLP. NID is an algorithm developed by M. Tsang, that is subsequently applied on a trained MLP to predict genetically mediated complex traits, to discover epistatic interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
